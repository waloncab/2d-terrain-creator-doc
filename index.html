                <p>
                    In order to create a new 2D Spline -> Go to the unity toolbar -> S-Lines/2D Spline.
                    A new game object will be created with their correspondent scripts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The tool is design withe spline as the core component. 
                    This means that for you to create the mesh or add prefabs, 
                    these must be extenden from the spline.
                </p>

                <h2>Spline</h2>

                <p>
                The spline is the core element of the tool. 
                For better user expirence there are some key features that ensure its 
                proper behaviour in a 2.5D enviroment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to see the full behaviour go to the 
                    <a href="https://waloncab.github.io/spline-tool-doc/">Spline Tool Documentation</a>

            <section id="mesh">

                <h2>Mesh</h2>

                <p>
                    There are quite a few thins that can be done with the meshes. 
                    These are the types of mesh you can create right now:
                </p>

                <h3>Base</h3>

                It creates a shape that goes below the spline into the the floor (0,0,0).
                It is the one you're porbabily going to use the most since it conforms
                the ground base.

                <h3>Cap</h3>

                In case you want you to use it, you can select from diferent typs of styles
                to customize the surface of the terrain.

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Sytle</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Picos</td>
                        <td>Select the first node</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Waves</td>
                        <td>Select the last node</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Random</td>
                        <td>Reset the spline</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h3>Box</h3>

                A simple square shape that may be useful for creating structures 
                such as bridges.

            <section id="prefab">

                <h2>Prefab</h2>

                <p>
                    To keep it as simple as posible (and as customizable as needed)
                    the way to create prefabs is by using a traversal component and attach the 
                    gameObject as a child.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This way you can create any offset needed with the unity transform tool.
                    Also any complex hirarchy can be achived. There is no cool interface,
                    but is the only way I can assure there are no limitations for the user
                    when it comes to create a complex prefab. 
                    Exmp: creating a coin that needs an offset to look hovering from the ground.
